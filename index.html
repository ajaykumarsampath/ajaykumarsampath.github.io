<b>Biography</b>: Hey, I'm Ajay and I'm from India. I received my bachelors in electrical and
electronics engineering from NIT Warangal, 2010. In 2012, I received my masters from IIT Delhi
with specialisation in control and automation. I worked as a software engineer for 8 months
WESEE (Weapons and Electronics Systems Engineering) where I worked on numerical platforms
estimation of actual signal from corrupt measurements. In 2013, I joined in the doctoral
program in computer, decision systems unit in IMT, Lucca, Italy. My supervisors are Alberto
Bemporad and Pantelis Sopasakis and discusssed my thesis in December 2016.

<b>Research</b>: My research focus on Model Predicitve Control (MPC), parallel optimisation methods
and high perfomace systems. My PhD title is "parallel methods of solving stochastic optimal
control: control for drinking water networks". Here we developed algorithms that can be
suitably parallised to solve the control problems associated with stochastic optimal
control. The GPU implementation is employed for economic management of water networks.
